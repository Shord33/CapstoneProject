Recommendation System:
-Could not implement using data in the database
-Console app included only represents a sample of how it should work using Cosine Similarity matrix, data declared is the same as in the database for ratings for all 10 movies from 3 users in the database
-Program will provide the movies with the top 3 highest cosine similarity score to movie 1 only
-This is to show that I understand how the system is supposed to work, sadly I could not implementit in the system itself in time.
